  description: "\tFortress Rolk sits on the edge of the empire, a shield against
    the yearly attacks of the Smiling King Across the Sea.  The Smiling King\u2019s
    undead, clad in gold, cross the sea each year to attack the Empire.  This year,
    however, the queen\u2019s war to the east with another human nation has weakened
    the empire.  Fortress Rolk sits now with fewer soldiers than ever..  Most soldiers
    that are young, elderly, or ex-criminals.  Amara Rolk, the Duchess of the area
    has hired mercenaries to help bolster their ranks.  Though the people of the
    empire distrust outsiders, especially magic users, they are desperate enough
    to hire a druid, dwarf cleric, and their charge to help them protect this fortress. 
    \tSurrounding Fortress Rolk is the Shadowgrasp.  The people here are afraid of
    outsiders.  Deserters from Fortress Rolk turned highwaymen prowl the footpaths. 
    People would still rather take a footpath than the woods which are full of giant
    beasts and the dead risen from the graves.  The undead here move quickly, silently,
    stalking their prey as predators.  They are near mindless compared to the carefully
    crafted puppets of the Skeleton King.  In actuality witches are more benevolent
    than most entities in the forest but remain highly feared.  Especially the blue
    one on the hill!  Only the truly desperate turn to them for help.  The story
    begins as a star crashes from the sky in the Shadowgrasp.  Mercenaries from Red
    Reach are sent to investigate this meteor which has landed on the hill of the
    blue witch.  Her hut was destroyed, she is surrounded by flames, this is where
    we start our tale\u2026 "
